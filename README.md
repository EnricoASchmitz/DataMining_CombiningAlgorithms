##  Description
The script compares heirachical clustering, Kmeans and particle swarm optimization. 
After running these "Basic" algorithms a combination between these methods is done, and this can then be compared to the 'basic' methods and see if it improves by combining.

## How to Run
Data.py is the main script and will call all other scripts automatically. The script can be called from the commandprompt or opend in your favorite IDE. The script contains some preprogrammed standard values.
